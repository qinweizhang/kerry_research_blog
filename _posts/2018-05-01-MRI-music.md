MRI scanner normally make a lot of noise due to the severe vibration of [the gradient coils](http://mriquestions.com/gradient-coils.html). Specifically, the fast changing currents in the coils causes the fast changing  [Amp√®re's force](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Amp%C3%A8re%27s_force_law) on these coils, hence the variation. Basically, the currents changing pattern in the gradient coils determines what sound the MRI scanner makes. 

Unfortunately, instead of making beautiful sound, the main goal for all currents changing patterns in MRI is to generate useful images efficiently, which means annoying noise. But if we want, we do have the possibility to generate music using the MRI scanner assuming we don't care the image at all. 

Here is an attempt I made

What's more interesting is that researchers have shown that there is [a way](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4715797/) to generating useful images while preserving the music. Maybe in the future, patients won't need the earplugs to protect themselves in the MRI scanner but enjoy the music while being scanned.
